# Library Management System in MERN Stack
- I'm building a Library Management System using MERN Stack.
- Currently, I'm working on its backend with `Node.js`, `Express.js`and `MongoDB`.
- This Repo is Open for Collaborations and Contributions.
- If you know react, you can contribute in building the frontend.
